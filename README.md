<h1>Todo List</h1>

<p>This project is a simple Todo List application developed as part of an apprenticeship recruitment process. It showcases my basic skills in building a web application using React.</p>

<h2>Functionalities</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering task descriptions in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.</li>
  <li>Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.</li>
  <li>Toggle Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as completed or undone by clicking the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are displayed with a strikethrough style.</li>
  <li>Filter Tasks: Users can filter the tasks based on their completion status. Three buttons are provided to filter tasks: "All" (displays all tasks), "Active" (displays only active tasks), and "Completed" (displays only completed tasks).</li>
  <li>Task Count: The app displays the total number of tasks in the list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of this exercise was to assess my ability to build a functional and interactive Todo List app using React. It tested my understanding of React components, state management, event handling, and basic CSS styling.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To run the Todo List app locally on your machine, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git</code></li>
  <li>Navigate to the project directory: <code>cd todo-list</code></li>
  <li>Install dependencies: <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>Start the development server: <code>npm start</code></li>
  <li>Open your web browser and visit: <code>http://localhost:3000</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to explore the code, make modifications, and enhance the app based on your own preferences or requirements.</p>
